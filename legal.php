			Alt-Options LLC Terms of Use
		</h2>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Introduction – Welcome to the User Agreement (hereinafter “Agreement” or “Terms and Conditions”) of Alt-Options LLC. The provisions of this Agreement will
			govern your use of our Site and of our services, and you should therefore take some time to read the Agreement carefully. The purpose of the Site and
			Services is to provide our users with an Exchange whereby users may trade certain virtual currencies and virtual currency derivatives (the “Exchange”). The
			Exchange does not issue such virtual currencies to its users; rather, the Exchange merely provides a means for users to conveniently trade or exchange
			their existing virtual currencies with other users. Should you have any questions or comments regarding our Site or Services, please feel free to contact
			us at: <a href="mailto:info@alt-options.com">info@alt-options.com</a>.
		</p>
		<h3 dir="ltr">
			1. Preliminary Provisions
		</h3>
		<p dir="ltr">

			this Agreement and may constitute computer hacking under applicable law.

			1.2. If you do not understand all of the terms in this Agreement, then you should consult with a lawyer before using the Site, Exchange, or the Services.
		</p>

		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.3.1. Alt-Options LLC and the operators of the website (“Site”), the Exchange, and any associated Services. Hereinafter, “Company” shall mean, in the case
			of U.S.and non U.S. customers, Alt-Options LLC. When first-person pronouns are used in this Agreement, (us, we, our, ours, etc.) these provisions are
			referring to the Company as publisher of this Site and provider of the Exchange. Additionally, when the terms “the Site” or “Site” are used, these terms
			refer to <a href="http://www.alt-options.com">www.alt-options.com</a>. Our Site, and the Services the Site provides, including the Exchange and the
			ancillary services (collectively, ”Services”), may contain images and content, including but not limited to text, software, images, graphics, data,

		<p dir="ltr">

			exchange virtual currency via the Exchange or use the Services.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">

			1.4. WHAT THIS AGREEMENT IS - THIS AGREEMENT IS A LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY. YOU SHOULD TREAT IT AS ANY OTHER LEGAL CONTRACT BY READING
			ITS PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY WILL AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. BY ACCESSING THE SITE OR USING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU ARE DEEMED TO HAVE READ,
			UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT. YOU MAY NOT PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH TERMS APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT
			AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST CEASE ALL ACCESS AND USE OF THE SITE AND ANY OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY. NOTHING IN
			THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO CREATE ANY ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS BY THIRD PARTIES.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.5. Consideration - Consideration for your acquiescence to all of the provisions in this Agreement has been provided to you in the form of allowing you to
			use our Site and our Services. You agree that such consideration is both adequate, and that it is received upon your viewing or using any portion of any of
			our Site(s) and/or Services.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.6. Electronic Signatures / Assent Required:
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.6.1. Nobody is authorized to access this Site or use the Services unless they have signed this Agreement. Such signature does not need to be a physical
			signature, since electronic acceptance of this Agreement is permitted by various jurisdictions’ laws, such as the Electronic Signatures in Global and
			National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) and similar legislation. You manifest your agreement to this Agreement by taking any act demonstrating your assent
			thereto. Most likely, you have clicked or will click a button containing the words “I agree” or some similar syntax. You should understand that this has
			the same legal effect as you placing your physical signature on any other legal contract. If you click any link, button, or other device provided to you in
			any part of our Site’s interface, then you have legally agreed to all of these Terms and Conditions. Additionally, by using any part of our Site or
			Services in any manner, including the Exchange, you understand and agree that such use constitutes your affirmation of your complete and unconditional
			acceptance to all of the terms in this Agreement.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.6.2. Even if you fail to sign this Agreement, you understand and agree that you are still bound by the terms of this Agreement by virtue of your viewing
			the Site or using any portion of the Site or our Services.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.7. If you are seeking information regarding any illegal activities, or seeking to engage in any illegal or fraudulent financial activity, please leave
			this Site immediately and do not attempt to use the Services. You acknowledge that you are aware of the legality of using our Services in your relevant
			local jurisdiction, and you agree that you will not use the Services, including the Exchange, if such use is prohibited or otherwise violates the laws of
			your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.8. Revisions to this User Agreement:
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.8.1. From time to time, we may revise this Agreement. We reserve the right to do so, and you agree that we have this right. Your continued use of the
			Site and the Services shall be deemed acceptance of the then prevailing terms and conditions. You agree that all modifications or changes to this Agreement
			are in force and enforceable immediately upon posting. Any updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior
			version is of no continuing legal effect unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions
			thereof in effect. To the extent any amendment of this Agreement is deemed ineffective or invalid by any court, the parties intend that the prior,
			effective provisions of this Agreement be considered valid and enforceable to the fullest extent, and all remaining provisions shall remain in full force
			and effect.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.8.2. We agree that if we make any material changes to this Agreement, we will send you an email or written notification regarding the change and include
			an updated version of this Agreement on our web page. The updated version of the Agreement will include a new “last modified” date at the top of the
			Agreement in order to identify the then-currently applicable Agreement. Following receipts of such a notice and the posting of the updated version of the
			Agreement on our web page, please re-review the Agreement in order to ensure that you understand how your rights and responsibilities may have been
			affected by the revisions.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.8.3. Waiver - If you fail to periodically review this Site and Agreement to determine if any of the terms have changed, you assume all responsibility for
			your failure to do so and you agree that such failure amounts to your affirmative waiver of your right to review the amended terms. We are not responsible
			for your neglect of your legal rights.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			1.8.4. Right to Prior Notice - You have the right to receive prior notice of any material change to this Agreement.

			2.2. We do not provide or issue our Members any virtual currency or virtual currency derivatives whatsoever. All virtual currency and virtual currency
			derivatives, including but not limited to Bitcoin (“XBT”) or Bitcoin Options (“XBT Options”) exchanged or traded by and between our Members originates from

			transferred to us by Members for use with the Exchange are held in an omnibus client account controlled by the Exchange. The Exchange maintains an internal
			ledger recording how much virtual currency each Member possesses in the omnibus client account, and all transactions between Members are based on such
			ledger.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">

		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">

			PURCHASE OR TRADE FOR ANY OTHER CURRENCY, BITCOIN, OR ANY OTHER THING WITH OTHER MEMBERS, AND ALL ASSETS, INCLUDING SUCH CURRENCY OR BITCOIN, THAT ARE
			DIRECTLY HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE INSURED BY A THIRD PARTY PRIVATE AGENCY. PLEASE NOTE THAT ALT-OPTIONS LLC WILL NOT MAINTAIN DEPOSITORY ACCOUNTS WITH A
			FDIC-INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION FOR CUSTOMER CURRENCY, AND CURRENCY DEPOSITED IN SUCH ACCOUNTS WILL NOT BE INSURED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF FDIC DEPOSIT
			INSURANCE. ALL CURRENCY TRADED OR PURCHASED BY YOU WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT UNTIL USED TO TRADE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OR UNTIL WITHDRAWN BY YOU.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.5. We are not responsible for any loss or damage incurred by you as a result of your use of our Services or for your failure to understand the nature of
			virtual currencies or the market for such currencies. All we are providing you is a method by which you can exchange, trade, and/or store certain virtual
			currencies, and we make no representations or warranties concerning the value, stability, or legality of virtual currencies.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.5.1. You acknowledge the following risks:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					The risk of loss in trading virtual currencies such as Bitcoin (collectively, “Digital Assets”) may be substantial and losses may occur over a
					short period of time.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					The price and liquidity of Digital Assets has been subject to large fluctuations in the past and may be subject to large fluctuations in the
					future.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Digital Assets are not legal tender, not backed by any government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance
					Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange and
					value of Digital Assets.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Some Digital Assets transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the
					customer initiates the transactions.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currencies for Digital Assets,
					which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that Virtual
					Currency disappear.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					There is no assurance that a person who accepts Digital Assets as a payment today will continue to do so in the future.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyberattack, and may mean that technological difficulties experienced by the
					Company may prevent the access or use of your Digital Assets.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Any bond or trust account we may hold for your benefit may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by you.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p dir="ltr">
			You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of those risks for you, and
			that the Company does not give advice or recommendations regarding Digital Assets including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment
			strategies for, Digital Assets. You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use the Services at your own risk. However, this brief statement does
			not disclose all of the risks associated with trading in Digital Assets. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you
			in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You should be aware that you may sustain a total loss of the funds in your Account (as defined
			below), and that under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.6. You understand and agree that, due to technical and other restrictions, the virtual currency values displayed on our Site may be delayed and therefore
			not reflect the current, live market value of such currency. Nonetheless, you agree that the values displayed on our Site control your Account and your use
			of the Site and Services, including the Exchange.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.7. While virtual currency market values as publicly displayed on the Site may be delayed, we may offer access to live market value data via technical
			measures such as the FIX (Financial Information exchange) protocol. This live market value data is valuable to us, and we take proprietary measures to keep
			all live market value data confidential and inaccessible to the public. To the extent that you receive access to such live data, you hereby agree that you
			will not redistribute, retransmit, duplicate, or otherwise make such data available in any way, either through automated, manual, or any other means. Any
			distribution or transmission of our live market values feed is a material breach of this Agreement as well as a violation of our trade secrets. You agree
			that we are not responsible for any failure or outage in the live market value data provided by us.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.8. In order to use the Exchange, you must create an account with us (your “Account”). Your Account will be used to store various virtual currency amounts
			as deposited by you. In creating your Account, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. In order to verify your
			identity, some of this information may be personal, private or detailed. In connection with completing the online registration form, you agree to provide
			true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form (such information being the "Registration Data"); and
			you further agree to maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete at all times while you are a
			Member. While we use reasonable efforts to protect the personal information of others from inadvertent release or misappropriation, we are not responsible
			for the intentional or criminal acts of third parties such as hackers or “phishers.” Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information on the use of
			your personal information.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.9. You must promptly inform us of all changes, including, but not limited to, changes in your address and changes in any virtual or fiat currency account
			used by you in connection with the Site and Services, if applicable. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete,
			or if we or any of our authorized agents have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we have
			the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site and Services, as well as subject you to civil
			liability or refer you to the appropriate law enforcement authorities for criminal prosecution. We shall not be liable to make any compensation, monetary
			or otherwise, following such suspension, termination or inability to use the Site or the Services. You are responsible for any fees that the Company incurs
			with respect to your Account. If you fail to reimburse us for any fees within thirty (30) days of our initial demand for reimbursement, you agree that you
			will pay us one hundred dollars ($100) as liquidated damages, being a genuine pre-estimate of loss and damage suffered by Us, as well as any costs incurred
			by Us for each fee incurred plus interest on the amount owed at a rate equal to the lesser of (is) 1% per month or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by
			applicable law.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.10. You are entirely responsible for any and all activities conducted through your Account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of
			your password or Member ID as well as of any other breach of security. While we may implement certain monitoring procedures designed to alert us to
			fraudulent activity, we are not responsible for any unauthorized use of your account, and you agree that you are responsible for such unauthorized use and
			for protecting the confidentiality of your password.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.11. Control or use of your Account may not be transferred, leased, assigned or sold to a third party. We disclaim any and all liability arising from
			fraudulent entry and use of the Site, Exchange, and other Services (including, but not limited to, liabilities arising from unauthorized trades executed
			through your Account). If a User fraudulently obtains access to your Account or the Exchange, we may terminate the User’s access and membership immediately
			and take all necessary and appropriate actions under applicable federal, state, and international laws.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.12. AS PART OF OUR SECURITY MEASURES AND POLICIES, PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEVER ASK YOU, FOR ANY REASON, WHETHER BY EMAIL, REGULAR MAIL OR TELEPHONE,
			TO DISCLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD. PASSWORD INQUIRIES WILL ONLY BE CONDUCTED ONLINE AND ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE SIGNED ONTO THE COMPANY’S SITE. WE WILL NEVER
			SEND YOU EMBEDDED LINKS IN AN EMAIL REQUESTING THAT YOU SIGN ONTO THE SITE BY CLICKING SUCH A LINK. IF YOU RECEIVE AN EMBEDDED LINK BY EMAIL, CLAIMING TO
			BE FROM US, YOU SHOULD NOT OPEN IT OR CLICK ON THE LINK. THE EMAIL IS NOT FROM US AND IS LIKELY FRAUDULENT. NEVER GIVE YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD TO ANYONE WHOM
			YOU DO NOT INTEND TO AUTHORIZE TO USE YOUR ACCOUNT.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.13. In order to provide you with the Services, including the Exchange, you may also be required to disclose certain other third-party account information
			to us, including, without limitation, your bank account number, your Bitcoin addresses and related information. As indicated elsewhere in this Agreement,
			we are not responsible for any unauthorized use of your Account with Us or any third-party accounts which you use in connection with the Exchange.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.14. Funding your Account - After creating your Account with us, you will be able to fund your Account by transferring, for example, XBT, from your
			accounts with such third party virtual currency providers into accounts operated by the Exchange. No fees are charged by us for funding your Account;
			however, third parties, such as your bank, may charge transaction and other fees.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.14.1. For example, to fund your Account with 100 XBT, you would use the third-party Bitcoin software to transfer your own pre-existing 100 XBT to the
			Exchange’s Bitcoin address for the omnibus client account. The Exchange would then credit your Account with 100 XBT on the Exchange’s ledger, and you would
			be able to trade those XBT for USD/EUR/SGD on the Exchange.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.15. Trading - After your Account has been funded, you may begin to trade your virtual currency with other Members. Trading is accomplished via bids and
			offers to buy and sell virtual currency. Specific examples and illustrations of how trading works may be found on the Site. We are not responsible for any
			disputes among or between Members regarding any transaction.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.15.1. Matching bids and offers to buy and sell virtual currency are automatically paired by the Exchange, and the Exchange will notify the respective
			Members that the order has been executed. Once a match is made, the order is executed and cleared instantaneously. YOU SHOULD ONLY PLACE A BID OR OFFER TO
			BUY OR SELL IF YOU FULLY INTEND TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. You have the right to stop payment of a preauthorized bid or offer to sell or buy virtual
			currency by initiating procedures through your Account online to effectuate closure of such open bid or offer.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.15.2. Members may only sell as much virtual currency as is recorded by us in the Exchange ledger plus the applicable Transaction Fee. Any attempt by you
			to sell more virtual currency than our records show exists in your Account after deduction of the applicable Transaction Fee will result in an unsuccessful
			trade and may be grounds for termination of your Account.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.15.3. Once an order has been executed and the appropriate currencies have been credited and debited from the Members’ Accounts, there is no way to
			reverse the transaction. The Exchange simply matches bids and offers put forth by Members and assists Members with carrying out the intent of the Member as
			expressed via the bid(s) offer(s).
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.16. Fees for Member Transactions - In order to provide the Site, Exchange, and other Services to you, we charge a fee on each transaction initiated by
			Members of the Site (“Transaction Fee”). The current Transaction Fee may be found on our Site. We reserve the right to change, modify or increase
			Transaction Fee from time to time. Any such changes, modifications or increases will be effective upon posting such changes, modifications or increases on
			our Site at <a href="http://www.alt-options.com">www.alt-options.com</a>. If you do not agree to the posted changes, modifications, or increases, you may
			delete your Account as provided in herein. Your first use of your Account following the posting of any changes or revisions to the terms of this Agreement
			or modified Transaction Fee as posted on the Site will constitute your acceptance of all such changes or revisions.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.17. Transaction Fees are paid by both the buyer Member and seller Member in any given transaction. The XBT buyer will be charged a fee in USD/EUR/CNY8
			and the XBT seller will be charged a fee in XBT. Any fees charged by a third party, including any third party provider of virtual currency when moving such
			virtual currency in or out of the omnibus client account, will be charged to the Member.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.18. Unless consented to by us in writing, (is) you may only transfer XBT to the same XBT addresses from which you transferred the XBT into your Account
			with us, if any.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.19. Withdrawing Currency - In addition to allowing Members to trade virtual currency, the Exchange allows Members to withdraw virtual currency upon
			request to us. Members may withdraw all or some of their virtual currency, and there is no minimum amount of virtual currency required to maintain your
			status as a Member (however, as indicated above, you may only trade or sell virtual currency up to the amount shown as belonging to you in the ledger
			maintained by the Exchange). XBT currency will be transferred from the Exchange’s account to Bitcoin address provided by the Member. Withdrawals will
			generally take up to three (3) days to complete, provided that larger withdrawals may take up to thirty (30) days to complete and that any withdrawal may
			be delayed as necessary to comply with applicable law and/or the Exchange’s customer identification and anti-money laundering procedures.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.20. A statement of your available currency balance and the status of your Account is available to you in electronic format for viewing online anytime
			(subject to down times) at the Site. You may review online all transactions that have taken place in the previous one year. You also have the right to
			receive a receipt, trade ticket or other evidence of a transaction.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.21. Trading Errors - If you believe that you have been erroneously charged a Transaction Fee, please notify us immediately of such error, along with any
			additional information concerning the transaction. If we do not hear from you within thirty (30) days after such alleged erroneous Transaction Fee first
			appears on any
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Account statement, such fee will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.22. Cancellation and Termination of your Membership and Account:
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			2.22.1. You may close your Account by providing written notice to us, and on such notice, a hold will be placed on your Account to allow all pending
			transactions to clear, if any. After notifying us of your desire to close your Account, you may use the Exchange to withdraw the remaining available
			currency associated with your Account.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">

			credit cards, discovery that any Member has used a stolen or fraudulent credit card will result in the notification of the appropriate law enforcement
			agencies and termination of such Member’s account.
		</p>

		<p dir="ltr">
			If a dispute arises between the Parties arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall meet and negotiate in good faith to

			either Party must submit the issue to binding arbitration in accordance with applicable Arbitration Ordinance. Claims subject to arbitration (“Arbitral

			underlying cause of action) by Us seeking injunctions, attachment, garnishment, and other equitable relief.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be finally settled on an individual basis –
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			(i) in the case of disputes involving customers of Alt-Options LLC, by arbitration in Delaware administered by the American Arbitration Association in
			accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The language of the arbitration shall be English and the Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
			State of Delaware.
		</p>

			An arbitral decision resulting from (i) above may be enforced in any court, and a prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement
			shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. Additionally, the Parties waive any right to trial by jury, as well as any right to participate in a class
			action lawsuit.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">

			seeking all other remedies available at law or in equity.

			to be in full force and effect.
		</p>
		<p dir="ltr">
			16.3. No Waiver. No waiver or action made by us shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent default of the same provision of this Agreement. No failure or
			delay in exercising or enforcing any privilege, right, remedy, or power hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of such provision by us. If any term, clause or
			provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any
